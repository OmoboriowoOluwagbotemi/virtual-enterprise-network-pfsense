# Virtual Enterprise Network Security Project (pfSense)

## 1. Introduction
This project demonstrates the design, implementation, and validation of a secure virtual enterprise network using pfSense as a perimeter firewall.

The project simulates a real-world corporate environment with controlled network segmentation, firewall rule enforcement, and traffic validation using packet captures.

---

## 2. Objectives
The objectives of this project are to:
- Design a secure enterprise-style network
- Implement firewall rules using pfSense
- Control and monitor internal and external traffic
- Validate security controls using packet-level evidence

---

## 3. Tools and Technologies
- pfSense Firewall
- VirtualBox
- Ubuntu Server (Internal services)
- kali linux Client (User endpoint)
- pfSense capture (Traffic analysis)
- Git & GitHub (Version control and documentation)

---

## 4. Network Architecture
The network is segmented into the following zones:
- WAN: External network
- LAN: Internal corporate users
- DMZ: Public-facing or semi-trusted services

Each zone is protected using firewall rules to prevent unauthorized access and lateral movement.

Refer to the `/architecture/` folder for network topology diagrams.

---

## 5. Security Controls Implemented
- Stateful firewall rules
- LAN-to-WAN outbound traffic control
- WAN-to-LAN ICMP blocking
- DNS traffic filtering
- DHCP lease management
- Network segmentation enforcement

---

## 6. Threat Model
The project mitigates common enterprise threats such as:
- Unauthorized external access
- Network reconnaissance via ICMP
- DNS misuse and traffic leakage
- Uncontrolled internal network access

---

## 7. Evidence and Validation
All security controls were validated using:
- Packet capture files (`/pcaps`)
- Firewall screenshots (`/screenshots`)
- Validation reports (`/validation`)

---

## 8. Learning Outcomes
Through this project, practical experience was gained in:
- Enterprise firewall configuration
- Network traffic analysis
- Security documentation
- Evidence-based validation of controls
