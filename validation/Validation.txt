# Security Control Validation Report

This document provides technical validation for all implemented security controls using packet-level evidence and firewall behavior analysis.

---

## Validation 1: DHCP Address Assignment

### Objective
Verify that internal clients can successfully obtain IP addresses from the DHCP server.

### Method
A client system was connected to the LAN interface and initiated a DHCP request. Traffic was captured on the pfSense LAN interface.

### Evidence
- PCAP File: `pcaps/DHCP_DORA.pcap`

### Result
The DHCP Discover, Offer, Request, and Acknowledge (DORA) sequence was observed, confirming successful IP assignment.

---

## Validation 2: Internal DNS Resolution

### Objective
Ensure DNS traffic from internal clients is permitted and functional.

### Method
An internal client performed DNS queries to resolve domain names. Traffic was captured for analysis.

### Evidence
- PCAP File: `pcaps/DNS_intranet.pcap`

### Result
DNS query and response packets were observed, validating correct DNS access through the firewall.

## Validation 3: ICMP Blocking from WAN to LAN

### Objective
Confirm that ICMP traffic originating from the WAN is blocked from reaching the LAN.

### Method
ICMP echo requests were sent from the WAN interface toward internal systems.

### Evidence
- PCAP File: `pcaps/ICMP_block.pcap`
- Firewall rule screenshots (`/screenshots`)

### Result
ICMP packets were dropped by pfSense as expected. No echo replies were received.

## Conclusion
All firewall rules and security controls functioned as designed.  
Packet-level evidence confirms effective network segmentation and traffic control within the virtual enterprise environment.
